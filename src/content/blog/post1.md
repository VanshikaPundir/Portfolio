During my internship at Locate Us Private Ltd., I worked on the Drogherâ€™s Hub Web Application using React.js, JavaScript, MySQL, and AWS. I updated and optimized the admin dashboard by integrating dynamic, real-time graphs to track sales trends, user activity, and inventory status.  

This enhancement improved data visibility, enabling the admin team to make faster, data-driven decisions.

This role strengthened my frontend development skills and gave me hands-on experience with real-world web applications.
