I developed a Caption Generator project using Machine Learning with Python, SQL, and AWS.

The model combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to automatically generate descriptive captions for videos.

This project enhanced my understanding of deep learning techniques and practical application of AI algorithms.
