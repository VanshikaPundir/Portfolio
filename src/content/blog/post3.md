Since December 2024, I have been working as a Content Moderator at Concentrix in Bengaluru.

My responsibilities include reviewing and evaluating user-generated content to ensure compliance with platform guidelines and community standards. This role requires strong attention to detail and critical thinking skills to maintain a safe and respectful online environment.

Working as a content moderator has enhanced my ability to analyze information carefully and work efficiently under strict quality standards. It has also strengthened my communication skills by collaborating with teams to resolve content-related issues.

This experience complements my technical background by improving my soft skills and understanding of user experience from a content perspective.
